git-repacker is a tool to inflate all the objects in a pack file
and write them into a new format, which I called 'UNPK'.

While the resulting 'UNPK' file will always be larger than the original
.pack file, it can be compressed afterwards in a single stream, for instance
with .xz, to make the final file much smaller than the original .pack.

USAGE:
To compress your .pack file use:
$ ./unpack.pl < pack-<sha>.pack > pack-<sha>.unpk
$ rm pack-<sha>.idx
$ xz pack-<sha>.unpk


To decompress that use:
$ xz -d pack-<sha>.unpk.xz
$ ./repack.pl < pack-<sha>.unpk > pack-<sha>.pack
$ sha1sum pack-<sha>.pack | cut -c1-40 | xxd -r -ps >> pack-<sha>.pack
$ git index-pack <pack-sha>.pack

The resulting pack file will be different from the original, I think
that's because of slight differences between various Zlib versions and flags.
So you might want to change the name of the pack file and update info/packs;
however I found git fsck and other git commands worked fine without it --
nothing seems to care if the pack file name actually matches the SHA1 at
the end.

DISCLAIMER:
It's pre-alpha stage experimental stuff. It will likely destroy all your data.
Be very careful.
